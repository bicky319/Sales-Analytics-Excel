# Sales & Finance Analytics for AtliQ Hardware

This project involved conducting in-depth sales and finance analysis for AtliQ Hardware, a company specializing in hardware and peripheral products. The objective was to analyze historical sales data to uncover insights, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and develop actionable reports. These insights aimed to support strategic financial decisions and enhance overall business performance through data-driven recommendations.


## Problem Overview
AtliQ Hardware collaborates with major clients like Croma, Best Buy, Staples, and Flipkart. However, its sales data was fragmented across multiple sources and lacked proper structure. In this project, I handled over 500,000 sales records and applied ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) techniques to clean, organize, and consolidate the data into a structured format. The resulting reports delivered meaningful insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and financial metrics—empowering AtliQ Hardware’s leadership to make informed strategic decisions and effectively track their financial objectives.
## Problem objectives
The primary objective of this project was to analyze AtliQ Hardware’s sales and financial data to deliver insightful, actionable reports that support data-driven decision-making.

#### Key Goals Included:

Applying ETL processes to clean, structure, and consolidate scattered sales data.

Developing comprehensive performance reports focused on sales, customer segments, and regional markets.

Identifying key trends in sales growth, product performance, and overall profitability.

Providing insights to enhance net sales, improve gross margins, and strengthen the company’s financial health.
## Data Preparation
The project utilized ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to prepare the sales and financial data for analysis:

Extract: Collected raw data from multiple sources, including CSV and Excel files.

Transform: Cleaned and transformed the data by removing duplicates, handling missing values, and aggregating records into a consistent, structured format.

Load: Loaded the cleaned data into Excel, where Power Pivot was used to build the data model. I employed DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to create calculated columns and measures, enabling advanced analytics and interactive reporting.
